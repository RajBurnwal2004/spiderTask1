For devops task:
  Run the script using sudo command . 
  The password for users with permission otherthan 700 is : "q1@w2@e3@r4@t5@" ; this is already mentioned in the script.
For javascript task, the html file is linked to the css and js files, so just create a folder in vs code containing these 3 files and run without debugging.
For dbms task, there are comments in the particular script.
For OS task, copy the code in any compiler and run it, I have taken an input of my choice in this example.
